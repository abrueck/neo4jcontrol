== System Tray tool for common tasks on a local Neo4j server

I write this little tool to help me for the following tasks on my development machine:

* Launch and stop a local Neo4j server instance
* Check the server status
* Open the Neo4j Browser, the documentation and the Cypher Refcard

=== Compiling and installation

Only execute "mvn package" and you can find the binaries in the "target/dist/bundles" directory.
After starting the tool the fist time, open the settings dialog enter the path to the Neo4j
server directory.


=== Limitations and issues

This is the first release of this tool and it has a lot of limitations and issues. If you have
ideas or issues please please let me know.
